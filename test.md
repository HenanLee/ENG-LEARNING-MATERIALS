Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials,

where we revisit past episodes for the

most potent and actionable science-based

tools for mental health, physical

health, and performance.

I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor

of neurobiology and of opthalmology at

Stanford School of Medicine. Today, I

have the pleasure of introducing Dr.

Samur Hatar as my guest on the Huberman

Lab podcast. And now, my conversation

with Dr. Samur Hatar. Samur, thanks for

sitting down with me.

>> My pleasure.

>> You are best known in scientific circles

for your work on how light impacts mood,

learning, feeding, hunger, sleep, and

these sorts of topics. So maybe you

could just weigh us into what the

relationship is between light and these

things like mood and hunger etc.

>> Sure. So I mean you do appreciate the

effect of light for vision. So when you

wake up in a beautiful area, beautiful

ocean, light is essential. The sunrise,

the sunset. So that's your conscious

perception of light. But light has a

completely different aspect that is

independent of conscious vision and

that's how it regulates many important

functions in your body. I think the best

that is well studied and wellknown is

your circadian clock. And the word

circadian comes from the word circa

which is approximate and dn is day. So

it's an approximate day. Why is it an

approximate day? Because if I put you or

any other human being who have a normal

circadian clock in a constant conditions

with no information about feeding time

about sleep time about what time it is

outside you still have a daily rhythm

but it's not exactly 24 hours. So it

will shift out of the solar day because

it's not exactly 24 hours and hence the

name sir.

>> How does that rhythm show up in the

tissues of our body?

>> It shows up at every level that we know

we studied. It shows up at the level of

the cell. It shows up at the level of

the tissue and it shows up at your

behavior. The most obvious for you is

your sleepwake cycle. You sleep and

you're awake and sleep at the 24-hour

rhythms. The period length of the sleep

rhythm on average is 24.2 hours. So

you'll be drifting 02 hours every day

out of the solar day if you don't get

the sunlight. So the the sunlight

adjusts that approximate day to an exact

day. So now your behavior is adjusted to

the light dark environment or the solar

day. It's part of the brain that is not

consciously driven. So you actually do

not know when it happens or when it

doesn't happen. And that what we'll get

into when I tell you why light affects

your mood and why sometimes people don't

know how to deal with light to improve

their mood for example. What's the

relevance? I mean why should we care

about that short difference?

>> So let's do the math. If you shift out 2

hours a day in 5 days you're shifting

out 1 hour. So you're literally 1 hour

off in your social behavior in 5 days.

In 10 days you're 2 hours off. And if

you're an organism that is living in the

wild, shifting out of the right phase of

the cycle, you could either miss food or

you could become food. So it's really

essential for survival. I think it's one

of the strongest aspect of survival for

animals to have the anticipation and the

adjustment to the solar cycle.

>> What is the the machinery that allows

that to happen and how does that

machinery work? Yeah. So we know we knew

that in mammals including us we are

mammals humans that the eyes are

required for this function. So if humans

are born without eyes or the optic

nerves are damaged humans are not able

to adjust to the solar cycle. So we know

that the eyes are required in the human

retinas. There are two types of photo

receptors. They are called rods and

cones because of their shapes. And these

rods and cones simply take the photon

energy which light is made of and they

change it in a way to an electrical

signal that allow us to build the image

of the environment in our cortices.

However, people have found including me

with the work of David Buren and Ignashi

Provenio that there is a subset of

ganglen cells. The ganglen cells are the

cells that leave the retina their axon

leave the retina and project to the

brain. So these were thought to only

relay rod and cone information from the

light environment to the brain. We found

that a small subset of these ganglen

cells are themselves photo receptors

that were completely missed in the

retina. And these are the photo

receptors that relay light environment

subconsciously

to the areas in the brain that have and

house the circadium clock or the

circadium pacemaker which adjusts all

the clocks in our bodies to the central

brain clock that allows them to entrain

to the 24-hour light dark cycle.

>> So these are cells that connect the eye

to the brain that behave like photo

receptors essentially. I think um it's

worth mentioning now that uh people who

are pattern vision blind so people who

cannot see but have eyes many of them

still have these cells these melanops

and intrinsically photosensitive cells

and can uh essentially match or entrain

as we say onto the light dark cycle.

>> In fact they possibly have no problems

in circadian photo entrainment. They'll

have enormous sleepwake cycle

>> but they're totally blind

>> but they are totally image blind. And

what's really interesting is that and

this story I heard from Chuck Seizler so

I'll give him credit that some of these

people who are image blind usually they

get dry eyes and they give them a lot of

pain and doctors used to think oh then

since they are image blind and they're

getting dry eye why don't you just

remove their eyes they're not using them

anymore and the minute they would remove

their eyes they start having cyclical

sleep problems indicating that now they

are not in training to the light dark

cycle and are having cyclical jet lags

when their clock shifts through the

light dark cycle.

>> That's really interesting. And uh I hear

from a number of blind people, a lot of

them have issues with sleep. I think in

part because they don't realize that

they too need to see light at particular

times of day or night in order to match

their their schedule.

>> Absolutely.

>> What is the proper way to interact with

light in the first part of the day?

>> Honestly, I think the easiest thing is

waking up. Get as much light as you can

>> into your eyes.

>> Yeah. It's really nice. Your system is

primed. If you're in trained, it's

primed to get light. The sun should be

out. Even when it's cloudy, you're going

to get enough intensity to help you

adjust your cycle to the dayight cycle.

>> These are general rules of thumb, but

how long do you recommend people go

outside?

>> So, if you do it daily, I would say 15

minutes. If you don't do it daily, you

may want to increase it. You do it more,

it doesn't hurt. And I'll tell you, if

you're sensitive, don't you don't even

have to go in the sun. You could be in

the shade. There's going to be so many

photons out there in the shade. is going

to be perfect.

>> Okay. And if um for some reason one

finds themsself very far north and it's

very very dense uh cloud cover, how long

and at what point should somebody

consider using an artificial light

source to mimic the sunlight? Yeah,

honestly this is where we don't have a

lot of information still because this is

where we're going to discuss this maybe

in more detail that if you put a humans

in artificial conditions the circadian

system is very sensitive to light but in

reality in the real environment light

also is affecting other aspects that are

independent of the setting of the

circadium pacemaker.

>> Okay. and these which we call the direct

effect of light on mood for example. So

that is very hard to figure out what

intensity you need to use and we haven't

done enough experiments because the

system has been discovered just recently

>> but yeah I mean if you're honestly if

you're that far north and you're in the

winter and you want to get make sure you

don't use these light boxes I I would

suggest that personally. Okay. So, I

think we've um have nailed down that

first part of the day. Basically, it's

get 10 to 30 minutes depending on how

bright it is and try and do that as as

often as possible to give the system a

regular

>> daily is the best. This system is really

about and and you'll see that even for

the effect on depression. It's about

multiple days. It's so you don't have to

worry if you missed it one day, you

know, stay longer if you want. But if

you're in a hurry and you want to do

other stuff, that's a great

recommendation. Mhm.

>> So, you might want to compensate with

some extra time if you missed a day or

two. I've heard you say before it's

entirely possible to get severely

jetlagged without traveling.

>> Absolutely.

>> Simply by staying in, being on your

phone too much, not getting the

sunlight.

>> And you saw this during the pandemic. A

lot of people mentioned that their

sleepwake cycles suffered a lot. Uh

because if you're not going out and if

you're staying at home and you don't

have big windows and you're waking late,

waking up late and then you're using

very bright light till late at night,

your body is going to shift and now your

day is going to start instead of like

really when the sun comes up, let's say

at 6:00 in the morning, it's going to

your day is going to start at 11:00 in

the morning. That's what your body's

going to think is the beginning of the

day. So then you're not going to be able

to sleep at 10 o'clock at night because

now that's really for for your body is

completely different timing. There is

this idea of chronotypes that we all

each intrinsically have a a best rhythm

of either being a morning person. You

called yourself an early person or a

night owl or more of a kind of standard,

you know, to bed around 10:30, up around

7 type um thing. And the and I think

there are now good data, correct me if

I'm wrong, from the National Institutes

of Mental Health and elsewhere showing

that the more we deviate from that

intrinsic rhythm, the more mental health

issues and physical health issues start

to crop up.

>> So there is great data on this and

there's a couple of things that

complicate this. The first is the people

who usually are late,

>> what what do you mean? People that wake

up late and go to sleep,

>> go to sleep late and wake up late, they

they have an overwhelmingly higher level

of depression because human notice that

people who go to sleep early and wake up

early, they do better in life. They

notice that

>> they just perform better.

>> They perform. But the question is is is

that intrinsic to the system or is that

society because society start things

usually early or late? That's a hard

question.

>> We discriminate against late risers. we

in a way we discriminate and I'm not so

sure that the circadian system is that

variable in the human population. I mean

clearly there are maybe some genetic

factors that make a small percentage of

like everything with a bell shape but I

think most of the time the light

environment may play a role and once as

you as we've talked about this is a

long-term effect of light once you get

into a rhythm it's hard to break out of

that rhythm because if you start

sleeping late and waking up late you're

not getting the morning sunlight

>> right

>> and so you you're just going to be late

>> it seems to me is the case is that the

only way to really know if you're meant

to be an early bird, as they call it, an

early person or a late person or

somewhere in between is to get morning

sunlight and figure out whether or not

that makes you feel better. So, what

should people do in the afternoon/ing

time in terms of their light viewing

behavior? I mean, the best thing to do

is to let the natural light creep in

into darkness, right? that would be the

best but clearly that would be

inefficient. You you want to go home,

you want to read, you want to talk to

your kids, you want to talk to your

family. So I think you know it's nice to

extend the day. I don't think that's

wrong if you somehow can block that

light from affecting your circadium

clock.

>> You do keep your home quite dim to dark

at night.

>> I am an extreme, but I measured it for

myself and I asked Reie, my wife, if

she's okay with it. She also liked the

dimness. Both of us can see well in in

dim conditions. But I think you have to

measure it for yourself. You really have

to do it's a very simple experiment.

Just try to dim the light as much as you

can. I I call it the minimum amount of

light you require to see comfortably.

You know, use red light that is very dim

if you want to keep the room for

sleeping. Red light that is very dim has

very small effect on on on circadium

clock. and below 10 locks of red light

literally doesn't affect sleep at all.

So, there are ways to do it.

>> I've seen you check your phone after

dark

>> once or twice. Um, and you did it by

sort of pointing your phone away from

you, right? It actually makes sense

that, you know, if you shine a

flashlight in your eye, it's much

brighter than if you shine direct line.

So, if you just look on the side, most

of the light is going to go this way and

you're only missing. And and even when I

check sometimes, I check it so fast and

switch it off so fast. So ideally I

should not check iPhones and iPads. I

don't use iPad at night because it's

hard to lower it enough cuz it's a huge.

But even my iPhone, I try not to use it

at night. You had a what I consider

absolutely landmark beautiful paper

published in nature a few years ago

showing that if you disrupt the exposure

to light or the timing of the exposure

to light that there are dramatic effects

on the stress system and on the learning

and memory system. So if I interpret

that correctly, that could mean that

when we view light and how much light

could make us feel happier or less happy

or even depressed, stressed, learning,

etc.

>> Bingo. Even if we're sleeping and waking

up at the appropriate times,

>> bingo. I mean, eventually, because we're

talking about the whole system,

eventually when you start having the

other problems, you also develop sleep

problems. But you're absolutely right.

And in fact now research from Diego

Fernandez in the lab have found that now

we know that they actually require

different brain regions. So we don't

only have a theory, we don't only have a

light environment that showed they can

be dissociated. We know that they use

completely different brain regions. So

the SCN that I told you about earlier,

the place where the central pacemaker

is, the one that receives direct input

from the retina through the IPRGCS to

adjust your circadian clock is not the

area that receives the light input for

mood regulation. It's a completely

different brain region. And what's

really amazing, this region also

receives direct input from the IPRGC's

but projects to areas in the brain that

are known to regulate mood including the

vententral medial prefrontal preffrontal

cortex which has been studied for many

years to be impacted in a human

depression. So just by by this amazing

serendipity to find that a region that

is so deep in the advanced brain like

the the prefrontal cortex is your

executive brain one of the most

elaborated in humans to see that they

receive input from these ancient photo

receptor was stunning to us.

>> How does that finding inform daily

protocols for you or for other people?

So that's why we came up with the

tripartate model because as a circadium

biologist I only thought of light

through the circadian clock affecting

behavior. As a sleep biologist they only

thought of the homeostatic drive

affecting sleep affecting behavior. And

for people who study light for vision

and other fun they thought only of the

environmental input. But now if you put

them all together you get with this

tripartate model where it's really

mindboggling and it makes so much sense.

The organism doesn't want to depend on a

single component. But if you could

incorporate these three together, you

could have a beautiful system that is

well adapted. So let me tell you the

sleepwake cycle, right? So we know there

is a homeostatic drive to affect sleep.

We've had beautiful talks about that

>> which is basically the longer you're

awake, the more you want to be asleep.

>> So that's your homeostatic drive. We've

talked about the circadian influence of

sleep and the fact that light dark cycle

affect the circadian system which

eventually affects sleep. So these two

components are well understood. Now the

third factor is your direct light or

environmental input. How much stress how

much light you get from there also can

highly impact sleep. So even if you have

a good circadian homeostatic drive if

you're getting light at the wrong time

of the day or if you're being stressed

and thinking at the then your sleep is

going to suffer. So you have to think of

the three together to have a beautiful

sleepwake cycle. Let's talk about food

and eating and appetite.

You had yet another

Yes, I I greatly admire your your

success in in this way. Yet another

incredible discovery showing that there

are directs of direct excuse me effects

of light on appetite and feeding

behavior. So for somebody who's

interested in affecting their eating

behavior, how should they use light in

order to adjust their eating behavior?

Right? So now that I've told you about

all these interaction between the

different inputs to the circadian clock,

just you think about it as an engineer,

what would be the best thing? The best

thing is to know when your food times

happen in the day. When should you get

light and where is your circad when is

your circadian clock in your system

right? So if you eat at very specific

times of the day that's another signal

that is telling your body your clock

you're in a certain time of the day. So

if you're having lunch at the correct

time every day and you're getting bright

light now you have two systems that are

informing your clock your clock is going

to be better. So regular meal times,

>> regular meantimes that fit your

circadian clock. So and in fact if you

do that when when I started doing this

and it helped me lose weight is that I'm

exposing myself to the right amount of

light dark cycle. I'm eating at regular

time. It is amazing. You will be not

hungry. Let's say let's say you eat at

noon. You will not feel any hunger at

11:45 and then all of a sudden the

hunger jumps. This is clearly not an

energy issue because it could not be

that drastic,

>> right? No, the desire to eat is mainly

driven by these uh these cues, these

hormone cues that are very exquisitly

timed to exactly

>> sleepwake cycle, but also to light.

>> Exactly.

>> How regular are you or do you recommend

people be about meal times? Are we

talking about down to the minute? Like

if I absolutely

>> All right. Plus or so 12 noon is my

normal lunch. Let's say uh plus or minus

>> half an hour.

>> Okay. Yeah. So eat around between 11:30

and 12:30

>> if if that's the time. And it depends if

you also do multiple meals. Remember

three meals that's a decision that

somebody came up with. I don't know why

>> nowadays people are fewer people are

doing that I think

>> given our friend Sachin Panda's work

>> right. I mean, so you could have two

meals, you could have very multiples

meals that are distributed across your

active time.

>> Some people are not hungry early in the

day. They might be late shifted people,

in which case eating later in the day

will will work well for them.

>> Work as long as they don't eat early in

the morning. That's just you have to

work with your schedule, with your

active schedule.

>> What we're talking about really is

finding your ideal sleep schedule.

>> Exactly.

>> And finding your ideal eating schedule.

>> Exactly. and understanding how those two

things interact.

>> And you know the nice thing as you said

finding them out is going to help you to

understand how they interact because we

know from the tripartate model that they

are all interconnected and for each

person they're going to be

interconnected differently. It's

striking to me that in all animals

besides humans, if they deviate too much

from the appropriate exposure to light

and light dark cycle, they essentially

don't mate andor die andor get killed

off. But in humans, we are able to

override that at least to some extent.

But the ways in which we suffer appear

to be things like obesity, metabolic

syndromes, uh reproductive syndromes

that are accompany the other syndromes,

you know, endocrine syndromes and mood

and depressive disorders. Is there any

effort at the level of the the

nationally or or laboratories that

you're aware of to try and use light in

order to improve mood and mental health?

>> I mean, honestly, this is my moonshot.

This is the thing that I think people

because it's I I I say don't take a pill

take a photo and not I mean you take

pills it's important I'm just making it

that really we have an opportunity right

now with the incredible advances of LED

lights of changing spectra of light of

regulating intensities

and just to assoc just for simple

changes you could really improve

sleepwake cycle productivity and still

you could actually get more done because

as we've talked about when you have all

these messed up now you have to sleep

more but your sleep is fragmented it's

not very good

>> and you can't focus

>> and you can't focus when you don't have

alertness when you need the alertness so

having all these you could allow you to

do even more actually at the end than

less and that's the the exciting part of

it

>> let's talk about jet lag

>> what are the two or three things that

people can do to adjust

their schedule quickly. Like let's say

fall classes are starting, you start a

new job or you have a baby or a puppy or

whatever. What is the best way to shift

the clock quickly? So, it's very simple

as we've talked yesterday. So, imagine

you're in in the outside with no

environmental with no industrial light.

If you if your body thinks you're in

early evening and you see a bright

light, what does this tell you? Oh,

wait. This is not early evening yet.

It's still early afternoon or late

afternoon. So I have to delay my clock

to go back to late afternoon. So if you

get light early in the evening, it

delays your clock. So what does

>> meaning that makes you want to go to

sleep later?

>> Yes. It delays your clock. So later in

the night, later in your night and

actually it just happens that in humans

you get a temperature in a deer later in

the night low temperature in your body.

After that, lights start advancing your

clock. If I understand correctly, what

you're saying is if your typical wake up

time is say 7:00 a.m., then your low

point in temperature probably occurs

somewhere around 5:00 a.m.

>> Yeah.

>> And if you view light right around then,

it's going to essentially advance your

clock.

>> Yeah. Because then your your body

thinks, oh, it's 7:00, so advance your

clock by 1 to two hours. But if I were

to view light, say at 3:00 a.m., then it

would probably delay my clock.

>> Yeah.

>> Okay. Yeah. So, and then let's say I

land in a new schedule. I want to adjust

to a new schedule. Let's say I didn't

manage to do anything with my light

viewing before I went and I didn't I

didn't anticipate the trip. Suddenly,

I'm on a new schedule. Okay. I was told

that one of the ways to help shift the

clock and to avoid gastrointestinal

issues is to eat on the local schedule.

Mhm.

>> to start basically behaving like a local

>> even though your circadian clock will

take a little bit of time to catch up.

>> Absolutely. But you have to remember the

light, right? So let's let's now that we

explained it very simply. Let's take a

very simple example, right? New York to

Italy. That's a simple example. New York

time, Italy time six hour difference,

right? So let's say you fly from New

York at night. You reach Italy at 8:00

in the morning. What is the time in your

New York time? You although you reach

>> 6 hours back

>> 6 hours. It's 2:00 a.m.

>> So when you land Italy, you want to

avoid light like the plague. Yeah, you

could eat, but you really don't want to

get a light,

>> right? Cuz otherwise it's going to

delay.

>> It's going to delay you. It's going to

send you to California instead of

sending you to Italy,

>> right? What Sam is saying is so crucial.

Just because getting bright light in

your eyes early in the day is really

beneficial when you're at home. When you

travel to a new time zone, you have to

take into account where your body thinks

you are. And so if you're looking at the

Italian sunrise, having just flown from

New York to Italy, and you didn't

prepare for that trip by waking up a

little bit earlier in anticipation,

>> multiple days,

>> and you view light at 2, excuse me, at

at 6:00 or 7 a.m. Italian time,

beautiful Italian sunrise, you are going

to delay your clock, you're going to

basically throw yourself back to

California, but you are in Italy. You're

going to throw your biology back to

California and you are going to be up in

the middle of the Italian night and

you're going to be ais miserable.

>> It's very important to avoid getting the

wrong light information when you're

trying to adjust your body because

otherwise it shifts you to the other to

the other side. Absolutely right. You

are one of these people that has such

vigor. I think a lot of your ability to

work hard and focus and really do so

many things at an impressive level is

because you think about these issues and

you you think about when you're going to

be optimal for focus, when you're going

to be optimal for exercise, when and the

when is the key. It's and I think a lot

of people live in the landscape of

feeling like there's something broken

inside them. I really agree with you

that I think part of the reason I'm

continuing to be able to do this that I

really think about it and I make sure

that I keep everything aligned and and

that actually helps me a lot like I

don't suffer in sleep I don't suffer in

waking up I never use a timer to wake up

system is so aligned it works a lot of

times people will say how come I go to

sleep I fall asleep fine but then I wake

up at 3:00 or 4 in the morning and can't

fall back asleep is it possible that

those people were supposed to go to bed

at 8:00 p.m.

>> Yeah, I mean it is possible uh or it's

possible that their clock is completely

misaligned that they are getting maybe

enough time at night when they are

supposed and then they possibly feel so

sleepy in the day. So there all these

are possible combination.

>> Oh that's an interesting idea I hadn't

considered. So that what they think is

their sleep their body is so out of

whack with the light dark cycle that

it's actually a nap

>> or or the weaker part of the sleep. I

mean, you see this in in when you travel

to different time zone before you

adjust. You go to sleep really well, but

2 hours later you're fully up. 2 hours.

If you were so tired and this is your

regular sleep, there's no way you're

going to wake up in 2 hours.

>> Let's talk about seasonality a little

bit. Are there other effects of

seasonality on humans that we are aware

of?

>> Honestly, you could see it perfectly, I

think, in in Scandinavia. I mean, you

could talk to people in who live in

>> Sure. They get seasonal depression.

>> What? Seasonal depression is one. But

actually when you start asking them

questions, they tell you like in the

winter they barely could wake up. They

barely have the energy. Before even

depression, even people who don't get

seasonal depression, they'll tell you

our energy level is lower. Our ability

to go to work is is not the same. And in

the summer, most people actually sleep

very little. They tell you we we really

can we we feel like we're manic. We have

all this energy. And not in a negative

way, in a funny way, right? I mean, but

if you want to sleep, we have to put

these curtain. I think in these

situations, you could really appreciate

the seasonality of a humans. I think we

kind of destroyed our seasonality

because we don't get exposed to that

much natural light. We have all this

artificial light. But I think honestly

one of the thing that is going to happen

if they follow your recommendation, this

is going to cause them to also

experience some changes across the

season because now they going to see the

sun differently. If you're going to go

out in the morning in the summer, you're

going to get a much bright. That's why I

don't like the change in time. I know

people think, "Oh, because you're

biased. You because I think

>> Wait, wait, wait, wait. Sorry. The

change are you talking about daylight

savings?"

>> Daylight saving. such a bad idea because

it disrupts that rhythm that you're

having because I think your body if you

keep that rhythm you will see the whole

seasonality and I look at it from a

different aspect than other people. If

you think about it Andrew there is a

situation where you're getting light

perfectly well and then all of a sudden

they delay it by 1 hour because and then

even though it's the summer your body

now if you're still not adjusting think

oh wait what happened? What kind of

happened? Well, I'm glad you're bringing

this up because I always thought, you

know, what's the big deal? One hour,

right? One hour shift, you know, spring

forward, fall back,

>> adjust one hour.

>> But the but this goes back to the

beginning of our discussion. It's not

just one hour,

>> right?

>> Because it's one hour across that one

day, but there's this cumulative effect

on the clock and these uh three elements

of your tripartite model, right? The

homeostatic, sleep, and the light direct

effects on mood. And when it's so close,

it's sometimes hard to figure out how to

adjust it perfectly because, you know,

we're already sleepd deprived in our

society. And then you shift it by, you

know, so it it just it all accumulates

and it has no benefit. I just don't

understand why they do this. It makes no

sense. Well, I think that the reason

they do it is because they don't

understand the biology because one hour

seems trivial unless you understand the

the repercussions of that 1 hour shift.

Because

>> what's also clear now based on what

you're saying is that that 1 hour shift

is taking you out of alignment with the

natural light dark cycle in exactly the

wrong direction. It's pushing people to

get even later.

>> Yeah.

>> In the summer when light is going to

push you later anyway. It's really

compounding the problem that already

exists.

>> Samur, this has been um an amazing march

through the importance of light. I'm

certain that people are going to start

thinking about how to change their

relationship with light as a way to

anchor everything that they do and

that's important to their health. Let's

talk a little bit about where people can

find you. Your laboratories at the

National Institutes of Mental Health. He

is head of the chronobiology unit. all

these things as I've mentioned earlier

but um you are active on Twitter and

Instagram

>> right

>> so what is your uh Twitter handle

>> it's Samarhat and I think the same for

Instagram

>> definitely give him a follow there and

on and on Twitter and um and I'm sure

that he'll be happy to answer questions

uh and enter entertain any and all

discussions about chronobiology

>> absolutely yeah and light yeah

>> great thank you Sam

>> awesome thank Thank you.
